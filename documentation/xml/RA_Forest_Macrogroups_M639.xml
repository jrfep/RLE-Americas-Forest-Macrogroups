It was estimated that, at the present rate of decline in tree cover, the geographic distribution could decline 33.3 % in a 50-year period; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable under sub-criterion A2b.

For historical representation of forest cover we used the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010)⁠ which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. We reclassified the layers and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area.

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which we calculated total forest cover per year. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. We converted land cover classes to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). We then averaged percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014)⁠. The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>                         </Data-descriptions>                         <Data-source>Hansen et al. 2013</Data-source>                         <Data-source>Friedl et al. 2010</Data-source>                         <Values method="projected">                           <Value level="1">                             <Year>2000</Year>                             <Indicator-value units="km2"></Indicator-value>                           </Value>                           <Value level="2">                             <Year>2050</Year>                             <Indicator-value units="km2"></Indicator-value>                           </Value>                         </Values>                       </Indicator-data>                     </Indicator-data-values>                     <Overall-Extent units="%" method="projected">33.3</Overall-Extent>                     <Collapse-threshold units="km2">0</Collapse-threshold>                   </Key-indicator>                 </Key-indicator-variables>               </Subcriterion>               <Subcriterion name="A3">                 <Summaries>                   <Summary lang="en">We considered presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroup.

Thus we considered climate change as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities⁠. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but we did not find a reliable indicator for changes in fire regime at the continental scale. For this macrogroup permanent and temporal water bodies form a relevant element of the ecosystem and interact with characteristic biota (e.g. species tolerant to flooding and high ground water levels) and important processes (e.g. nutrient cycling, vegetation growth; Keddy et al. 2009)⁠. We considered flood regime and surface water as an important component of these forest macrogroups. A global indicator of trends in water surface was used for this assessment (Pekel et al. 2016)⁠.</Summary>             </Summaries>             <Rationales>               <Rationale lang="en">None of the assessed subcriteria met the threshold for Vulnerable, and under this criterion this Macrogroup is considered Least Concern</Rationale>             </Rationales>             <Category>               <Category>LC</Category>             </Category>             <Subcriterions>               <Subcriterion name="C1">                 <Summaries>                   <Summary lang="en">The data used to estimate deterioration of environmental conditions was relevant to present and future  time frames, but not applicable to historic or past time frames.

We used a set of 19 standard bioclimatic variables as indicators of characteristic environmental conditions (Hijmans et al. 2005)⁠ and used a Random Forest Classification algorithm to evaluate suitability of environmental conditions under current climate and future projections based on climate change models. We evaluated the probability of the target macrogroup to be replaced by any forest or non-forest vegetation macrogroup under changing climatic conditions.

All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). We used the *random forest* (RF) algorithm, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002)⁠ to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First we define a bounding box around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location we record the potential macrogroup according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. We partition the data in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation⁠. Then we fitted the RF model with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes⁠, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and  different threshold of model support (proportion of “votes”, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box we used RF-model prediction (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). We compared predictions based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). We summarized the results of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017)⁠. This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>                         </Data-descriptions>                         <Data-source>Hijmans et al. 2005</Data-source>                         <Data-source>Liaw and Wiener 2002</Data-source>                         <Values method="projected">                           <Value level="1">                             <Year>2050</Year>                             <Indicator-value units=""></Indicator-value>                           </Value>                         </Values>                       </Indicator-data>                     </Indicator-data-values>                     <Overall-Extent units="%" method="projected">100</Overall-Extent>                     <Overall-Severity units="%" method="projected"></Overall-Severity>                     <Collapse-threshold units="">We considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup.</Collapse-threshold>                   </Key-indicator>                 </Key-indicator-variables>               </Subcriterion>               <Subcriterion name="C2b">                 <Summaries>                   <Summary lang="en">For this macrogroup the permanent and temporal water bodies form a relevant element of the ecosystem and interact with characteristic biota (e.g. species tolerant to flooding and high ground water levels) and important processes (e.g. nutrient cycling, vegetation growth)⁠.

We overlapped the Macrogroups potential distribution maps and the GSW occurrence layer to calculate the amount of area covered by surface water, and then overlapped the potential distribution maps and the GSW change layer to measure the amount of surface water area lost between epochs. The reference time period (1984-1999) represents the initial value and the recent time period (2000-2015) represent the final value. We set 85% decline as the collapse threshold.

We crossed the potential distribution of the Macrogroup with the distinct woodland cover classes, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). We assume that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential'). We considered equal step weights for changes between consecutive classes, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. We do not have a quantitative estimate of collapse, but assume that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential').</Data-description>                         </Data-descriptions>                         <Data-source>Ellis, E.C., Goldewijk, K.K., Siebert, S., Lightman, D. and Ramankutty, N.
