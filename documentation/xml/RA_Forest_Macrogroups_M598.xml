It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 56.7 % in the past 50 years; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under sub-criterion A1. Uncertainty in this estimate (90% C.I. 20.7 -- 76.4 %) suggests a plausible range from Least Concern to Endangered. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 82.9 % historically; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under sub-criterion A3. Uncertainty in this estimate (90% C.I. 62.5 -- 92.2 %) suggests a plausible range from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered.

We reclassified the layers and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion we used the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000.</Data-description>                         </Data-descriptions>                         <Data-source>Ellis, E.C., Goldewijk, K.K., Siebert, S., Lightman, D. and Ramankutty, N.

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which we calculated total forest cover per year. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. We converted land cover classes to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). We then averaged percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014)⁠. The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>                         </Data-descriptions>                         <Data-source>Hansen et al. 2013</Data-source>                         <Data-source>Friedl et al. 2010</Data-source>                         <Values method="projected">                           <Value level="1">                             <Year>2000</Year>                             <Indicator-value units="km2"></Indicator-value>                           </Value>                           <Value level="2">                             <Year>2050</Year>                             <Indicator-value units="km2"></Indicator-value>                           </Value>                         </Values>                       </Indicator-data>                     </Indicator-data-values>                     <Overall-Extent units="%" method="projected">48.2</Overall-Extent>                     <Collapse-threshold units="km2">0</Collapse-threshold>                   </Key-indicator>                 </Key-indicator-variables>               </Subcriterion>               <Subcriterion name="A3">                 <Summaries>                   <Summary lang="en">We considered presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroup.

We reclassified the layers and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame.

We used a set of 19 standard bioclimatic variables as indicators of characteristic environmental conditions (Hijmans et al. 2005)⁠ and used a Random Forest Classification algorithm to evaluate suitability of environmental conditions under current climate and future projections based on climate change models. We evaluated the probability of the target macrogroup to be replaced by any forest or non-forest vegetation macrogroup under changing climatic conditions.

All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). We used the *random forest* (RF) algorithm, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002)⁠ to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First we define a bounding box around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location we record the potential macrogroup according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. We partition the data in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation⁠. Then we fitted the RF model with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes⁠, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and  different threshold of model support (proportion of “votes”, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box we used RF-model prediction (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). We compared predictions based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). We summarized the results of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017)⁠. This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>                         </Data-descriptions>                         <Data-source>Hijmans et al. 2005</Data-source>                         <Data-source>Liaw and Wiener 2002</Data-source>                         <Values method="projected">                           <Value level="1">                             <Year>2050</Year>                             <Indicator-value units=""></Indicator-value>                           </Value>                         </Values>                       </Indicator-data>                     </Indicator-data-values>                     <Overall-Extent units="%" method="projected">100</Overall-Extent>                     <Overall-Severity units="%" method="projected"></Overall-Severity>                     <Collapse-threshold units="">We considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup.</Collapse-threshold>                   </Key-indicator>                 </Key-indicator-variables>               </Subcriterion>               <Subcriterion name="C2b">                 <Summaries>                   <Summary lang="en">The data used to estimate deterioration of environmental conditions was relevant to future  time frames, but not applicable to present, historic or past time frames.

According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017)⁠⁠, we used the following formula to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . We then transformed the spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values we estimated the decline as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values we assumed zero decline. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. We assume that the applied formula represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance.

We considered equal step weights for changes between consecutive classes, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. We do not have a quantitative estimate of collapse, but assume that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential').</Data-description>                         </Data-descriptions>                         <Data-source>Ellis, E.C., Goldewijk, K.K., Siebert, S., Lightman, D. and Ramankutty, N.
